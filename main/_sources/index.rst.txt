Bluesky Data Collection Framework
=================================

Bluesky is a library for experiment control and collection of scientific data
and metadata. It emphasizes the following virtues:

* **Live, Streaming Data:** Available for inline visualization and processing.
* **Rich Metadata:** Captured and organized to facilitate reproducibility and
  searchability.
* **Experiment Generality:** Seamlessly reuse a procedure on completely
  different hardware.
* **Interruption Recovery:** Experiments are "rewindable," recovering cleanly
  from interruptions.
* **Automated Suspend/Resume:** Experiments can be run unattended,
  automatically suspending and resuming if needed.
* **Pluggable I/O:** Export data (live) into any desired format or database.
* **Customizability:** Integrate custom experimental procedures and commands,
  and get the I/O and interruption features for free.
* **Integration with Scientific Python:** Interface naturally with numpy and
  Python scientific stack.

How to Use This Documentation
-----------------------------

Start with the :doc:`tutorial`. It's a good place to start for everyone, and it
gives a good overview of the project in a narrative style. Read as far as you
need to solve your problem, and come back again if your needs change. Each
section of the tutorial adds a piece of complexity in exchange for deeper
customization.

The remaining sections document bluesky's behavior in a less narrative style,
providing clear API documentation intermixed with some examples and explanation
of design and intent.
