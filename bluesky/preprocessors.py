def plan_mutator(plan, msg_proc):
    """
    Alter the contents of a plan on the fly by changing or inserting messages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plan : generator

        a generator that yields messages (`Msg` objects)
    msg_proc : callable
        This function takes in a message and specifies messages(s) to replace
        it with. The function must account for what type of response the
        message would prompt. For example, an 'open_run' message causes the
        RunEngine to send a uid string back to the plan, while a 'set' message
        causes the RunEngine to send a status object back to the plan. The
        function should return a pair of generators ``(head, tail)`` that yield
        messages. The last message out of the ``head`` generator is the one
        whose response will be sent back to the host plan. Therefore, that
        message should prompt a response compatible with the message that it is
        replacing. Any responses to all other messages will be swallowed. As
        shorthand, either ``head`` or ``tail`` can be replaced by ``None``.
        This means:

        * ``(None, None)`` No-op. Let the original message pass through.
        * ``(head, None)`` Mutate and/or insert messages before the original
          message.
        * ``(head, tail)`` As above, and additionally insert messages after.
        * ``(None, tail)`` Let the original message pass through and then
          insert messages after.

        The reason for returning a pair of generators instead of just one is to
        provide a way to specify which message's response should be sent out to
        the host plan. Again, it's the last message yielded by the first
        generator (``head``).

    msg : Msg

    Run the first plan and then the second.  If any of the messages
    raise an error in the RunEngine (or otherwise), the second plan
    will attempted to be run anyway.

    Notice that, this decorator requires a generator *function* so that it can
    be used multiple times, whereas :func:`bluesky.plans.finalize_wrapper`
    accepts either a generator function or a generator instance.

    ----------
    final_plan : callable
        a callable that returns a generator, list, or similar containing `Msg`
        objects; attempted to be run no matter what happens in the first plan

    Yields
    ------
    msg : Msg
        messages from `plan` until it terminates or an error is raised, then

class SupplementalData:
    """
    A configurable preprocessor for supplemental measurements

    This is a plan preprocessor. It inserts messages into plans to:

    * take "baseline" readings at the beginning and end of each run for the
      devices listed in its ``baseline`` atrribute
    * monitor signals in its ``monitors`` attribute for asynchronous
      updates during each run.
    * kick off "flyable" devices listed in its ``flyers`` attribute at the
      beginning of each run and collect their data at the end

    Internally, it uses the plan preprocessors:

    * :func:`baseline_wrapper`
    * :func:`monitor_during_wrapper`
    * :func:`flyer_during_wrapper`

    Parameters
    ----------
    baseline : list
        Devices to be read at the beginning and end of each run
    monitors : list
        Signals (not multi-signal Devices) to be monitored during each run,
        generating readings asynchronously
    flyers : list
        "Flyable" Devices to be kicked off before each run and collected
        at the end of each run

    Examples
    --------
    Create an instance of SupplementalData and apply it to a RunEngine.

    >>> sd = SupplementalData(baseline=[some_motor, some_detector]),
    ...                       monitors=[some_signal],
    ...                       flyers=[some_flyer])
    >>> RE = RunEngine({})
    >>> RE.preprocessors.append(sd)

    Now all plans executed by RE will be modified to add baseline readings
    (before and after each run), monitors (during each run), and flyers
    (kicked off before each run and collected afterward).

    Inspect or update the lists of devices interactively.

    >>> sd.baseline
    [some_motor, some_detector]

    >>> sd.baseline.remove(some_motor)

    >>> sd.baseline
    [some_detector]

    >>> sd.baseline.append(another_detector)

    >>> sd.baseline
    [some_detector, another_detector]

    Each attribute (``baseline``, ``monitors``, ``flyers``) is an ordinary
    Python list, support all the standard list methods, such as:

    >>> sd.baseline.clear()

    The arguments to SupplementalData are optional. All the lists
    will empty by default.  As shown above, they can be populated
    interactively.

    >>> sd = SupplementalData()
    >>> RE = RunEngine({})
    >>> RE.preprocessors.append(sd)
    >>> sd.baseline.append(some_detector)
