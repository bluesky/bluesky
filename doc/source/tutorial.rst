Before You Begin
================

.. note::

    NSLS-II deploys a free, public "sandbox" for trying the software in the
    browser using Jupyter notebooks. There will be no need to install any
    software, and you can skip the rest of this section.  Go to
    `https://try.nsls2.bnl.gov <https://try.nsls2.bnl.gov>`_.

* You will need Python 3.5 or newer. From a shell ("Terminal" on OSX,
  "Command Prompt" on Windows), check your current Python version.

  .. code-block:: bash

    python3 --version

  If that version is less than 3.5, you must update it.

  We recommend install bluesky into a "virtual environment" so this
  installation will not interfere with any existing Python software:

  .. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv ~/bluesky-tutorial
    source ~/bluesky-tutorial/bin/activate

  Alternatively, if you are a
  `conda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html>`_ user,
  you can create a conda environment:

  .. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n bluesky-tutorial "python>=3.5"
    conda activate bluesky-tutorial

* Install the latest versions of bluesky and ophyd. Also install the databroker
  unless you plan to skip the sections about accessing saved data. Finally,
  install IPython (a Python interpreter designed by scientists for scientists).

  .. code-block:: bash

     python3 -m pip install --upgrade bluesky ophyd databroker ipython matplotlib

  Alternatively, if you are a conda user and you prefer conda packages, you can
  use:

  .. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c lightsource2-tag bluesky ophyd databroker ipython matplotlib

* Start IPython:

  .. code-block:: python

    ipython --matplotlib=qt5

  The flag ``--matplotlib=qt5`` is necessary for live-updating plots to work.

If you get lost or confused...
==============================

...then we want to know! We have a friendly
`chat channel <https://gitter.im/NSLS-II/DAMA>`_, or you can
`file a bug <https://github.com/NSLS-II/Bug-Reports/issues>`_ to let us know
where our documentation could be made more clear.

.. _tutorial_run_engine_setup:

The RunEngine
=============

Bluesky encodes an experimental procedure as a *plan*, a sequence of
atomic instructions. The *RunEngine* is an interpreter for plans. It lets
us focus on the logic of our experimental procedure while it handles important
technical details consistently: it communicates with hardware, monitors for
interruptions, organizes metadata and data, coordinates I/O, and ensures that
the hardware is left in a safe state at exit time.

This separation of the executor (the RunEngine) from the instruction set (the
plan) pays off in several ways, as we will see in the examples that follow.

.. note::

    If you are a visiting user at a facility that runs bluesky, you can skip
    this section and go straight to :ref:`common_experiments`. A RunEngine will
    have already been configured for you. **If you ignore this and define your
    own, you may be overriding pre-configured defaults, which can result in
    data loss.**

    To check, type ``RE``. If a RunEngine has already been configured, you
    should get something like:

    .. ipython::
        :verbatim:

        In [1]: RE
        Out[1]: <bluesky.run_engine.RunEngine at 0x10fd1d978>

    and you should skip the rest of this section. But if this gives you a
    ``NameError``, you'll need to finish this section.

Create a RunEngine:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky import RunEngine

    RE = RunEngine({})

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    # for use in later demos
    from bluesky import RunEngine
    RE = RunEngine({})


This RunEngine is ready to use --- but if you care about visualizing or saving
your data, there is more to do first....

During data acquisition, the RunEngine dispatches a live stream of metadata and
data to one or more consumers ("callbacks") for in-line data processing and
visualization and long-term storage. Example consumers include a live-updating
plot, a curve-fitting algorithm, a database, a message queue, or a file in your
preferred format. See :doc:`callbacks` for more detail.

Prepare Live Visualization
--------------------------

To start, let's use the all-purpose
:class:`~bluesky.callback.best_effort.BestEffortCallback`.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.callbacks.best_effort import BestEffortCallback
    bec = BestEffortCallback()

    # Send all metadata/data captured to the BestEffortCallback.
    RE.subscribe(bec)

    # Make plots update live while scans run.
    from bluesky.utils import install_kicker
    install_kicker()

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    # for use in later demos
    from bluesky.callbacks.best_effort import BestEffortCallback
    bec = BestEffortCallback()
    RE.subscribe(bec)

The :class:`~bluesky.callback.best_effort.BestEffortCallback` will receive the
metadata/data in real time and produce plots and text, doing its best to
provide live feedback that strikes the right balance between "comprehensive"
and "overwhelming."

For more tailored feedback, customized to a particular experiment, you may
configure custom callbacks. Start by reading up on :doc:`documents`, the
structure into which bluesky organized metadata and data captured during an
experiment. But for this tutorial and for many real experiments, the
:class:`~bluesky.callback.best_effort.BestEffortCallback` will suffice.

Prepare Data Storage
--------------------

.. _databroker_setup:

The `databroker <https://nsls-ii.github.io>`_, a library developed in tandem
with bluesky, is an interface to searchable storage for metadata and data
generated by bluesky. For this tutorial, we will spin up a databroker backed by
temporary files.

.. code-block:: python

    from databroker import Broker
    db = Broker.named('temp')

    # Insert all metadata/data captured into db.
    RE.subscribe(db.insert)

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    # for use in later demos
    from databroker import Broker
    db = Broker.named('temp')
    RE.subscribe(db.insert)

.. warning::

    **This example makes a temporary database. Do not use it for important
    data.** The data will become difficult to access once Python exits or the
    variable ``db`` is deleted. Running ``Broker.named('temp')`` a second time
    creates a fresh, separate temporary database.

Add a Progress Bar
------------------

Optionally, you can configure a progress bar.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.utils import ProgressBarManager
    RE.waiting_hook = ProgressBarManager()

See :doc:`progress-bar` for more details and configuration.

Let's take some data!

.. _common_experiments:

Common Experiments ("Plans")
============================

Read Some Detectors
-------------------

Begin with a very simple experiment: trigger and read some detectors. Bluesky
calls this "counting", a term of art inherited from the spectroscopy
community.

For this tutorial, we will not assume that you have access to real detectors or
motors. In the examples that follow, we will use simulated hardware from
`ophyd <https://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd>`_, a library developed in tandem with
bluesky. In a :ref:`later section <tutorial_device>` we will see what it looks
like to configure *real* hardware with ophyd.

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det1, det2  # two simulated detectors

Using the RunEngine, ``RE``, "count" the detectors:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import count
    dets = [det1, det2]   # a list of any number of detectors

    RE(count(dets))

Demo:

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    from bluesky.plans import count
    from ophyd.sim import det1, det2
    dets = [det1, det2]

.. ipython:: python

    RE(count(dets))

A key feature of bluesky is that these detectors could be simple photodiodes or
complex CCDs. All of those details are captured in the implementation of the
Device. From the point of view of bluesky, detectors are just Python objects
with certain methods.

See :func:`~bluesky.plans.count` for more options. You can also view this
documentation in IPython by typing ``count?``.

Try the following variations:

.. code-block:: python

    # five consecutive readings
    RE(count(dets, num=5))

    # five sequential readings separated by a 1-second delay
    RE(count(dets, num=5, delay=1))

    # a variable delay
    RE(count(dets, num=5, delay=[1, 2, 3, 4]))

The :func:`~bluesky.plans.count` function (more precisely, Python *generator
function*) is an example of a *plan*, a sequence of instructions encoding an
experimental procedure. We'll get a better sense for why this design is useful
as we continue. Briefly, it empowers us to:

* Introspect the instructions before we execute them, checking for accuracy,
  safety, estimated duration, etc.
* Interrupt and "rewind" the instructions to a safe point to resume from,
  both interactively and automatically (e.g. in the middle of the night).
* Reuse a generic set of instructions on different hardware.
* Modify the instructions programmatically, such as inserting a set of
  baseline readings to be taken automatically before every experiment.

.. warning::

    Notice that entering a plan by itself doesn't do anything:

    .. ipython:: python
        :suppress:

        from bluesky.plans import count
        from ophyd.sim import det
        dets = [det]

    .. ipython:: python

        count(dets, num=3)

    If we mean to *execute* the plan, we must use the RunEngine:

    .. ipython:: python

        RE(count(dets, num=3))

Scan
----

Use :func:`~bluesky.plans.scan` to scan ``motor`` from ``-1`` to ``1`` in ten
equally-spaced steps, wait for it to arrive at each step, and then trigger and
read some detector, ``det``.

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    from bluesky.plans import scan
    dets = [det]   # just one in this case, but it could be more than one

    RE(scan(dets, motor, -1, 1, 10))

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    from bluesky.plans import scan
    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    dets = [det]

.. ipython:: python

    RE(scan(dets, motor, -1, 1, 10))

.. plot::

    from bluesky.plans import scan
    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    dets = [det]
    RE(scan(dets, motor, -1, 1, 10))

Again, a key feature of bluesky is that ``motor`` may be any "movable" device,
including a temperature controller, a sample changer, or some pseudo-axis. From
the point of view of bluesky and the RunEngine, all of these are just objects
in Python with certain methods.

In addition the producing a table and plot, the
:class:`~bluesky.callback.best_effort.BestEffortCallback` computes basic peak
statistics. Click on the plot area and press Shift+P ("peaks") to visualize
them over the data. The numbers (center of mass, max, etc.) are available in a
dictionary stashed as ``bec.peaks``. This is updated at the end of each run.
Of course, if peak statistics are not applicable, you may just ignore this
feature.

Use :func:`~bluesky.plans.rel_scan` to scan from ``-1`` to ``1`` *relative to
the current position*.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import rel_scan

    RE(rel_scan(dets, motor, -1, 1, 10))

Use :func:`~bluesky.plans.list_scan` to scan points with some arbitrary
spacing.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import list_scan

    points = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

    RE(list_scan(dets, motor, points))

For a complete list of scan variations and other plans, see :doc:`plans`.

.. _tutorial_multiple_motors:

Scan Multiple Motors Together
-----------------------------

There are two different things we might mean by the phrase "scan multiple
motors 'together'". In this case we mean that we move N motors along a line in
M steps, such as moving X and Y motors along a diagonal. In the other case, we
move N motors through an (M_1 x M_2 x ... x M_N) grid; that is addressed in the
next section.

SPEC users may recognize this case as analogous to an "a2scan" or "d2scan", but
with an arbitrary number of dimensions, not just two.

We'll use the same plans that we used in the previous section. (If you already
imported them, there is no need to do so again.)

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import scan, rel_scan

We'll use two new motors and a new detector that is coupled to them via
a simulation. It simulates a 2D Gaussian peak centered at ``(0, 0)``.
Again, we emphasize that these "motors" could be anything that can be "set"
(temperature controller, pseudo-axis, sample changer).

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det4, motor1, motor2
    dets = [det4]   # just one in this case, but it could be more than one

The plans :func:`~bluesky.plans.scan` and  :func:`~bluesky.plans.rel_scan`
accept multiple motors.

.. code-block:: python

    RE(scan(dets,
            motor1, -1.5, 1.5,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5
            motor2, -0.1, 0.1,  # ...while scanning motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1
            11))  # ...both in 11 steps

The line breaks are intended to make the command easier to visually parse. They
are not technically meaningful; you may take them or leave them.

Demo:

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    from bluesky.plans import scan
    from ophyd.sim import det4, motor1, motor2
    dets = [det4]

.. ipython:: python

    RE(scan(dets,
            motor1, -1.5, 1.5,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5
            motor2, -0.1, 0.1,  # ...while scanning motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1
            11))  # ...both in 11 steps

.. plot::

    from bluesky.plans import scan
    from ophyd.sim import det4, motor1, motor2
    dets = [det4]
    RE(scan(dets,
            motor1, -1.5, 1.5,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5
            motor2, -0.1, 0.1,  # ...while scanning motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1
            11))  # ...both in 11 steps

This works for any number of motors, not just two. Try importing ``motor3``
from ``ophyd.sim`` and running a 3-motor scan.

To move motors along arbitrary trajectories instead of equally-spaced points,
use :func:`~bluesky.plans.list_scan` and :func:`~bluesky.plans.rel_list_scan`.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import list_scan

    # Scan motor1 and motor2 jointly through a 5-point trajectory.
    RE(list_scan(dets, motor1, [1, 1, 3, 5, 8], motor2, [25, 16, 9, 4, 1]))

Demo:

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   from bluesky.plans import list_scan

.. ipython:: python

    RE(list_scan(dets,
                 motor1, [1, 1, 3, 5, 8],
                 motor2, [25, 16, 9, 4, 1]))

.. plot::

    from bluesky.plans import list_scan
    from ophyd.sim import det4, motor1, motor2
    dets = [det4]
    RE(list_scan(dets,
                 motor1, [1, 1, 3, 5, 8],
                 motor2, [25, 16, 9, 4, 1]))

Scan Multiple Motors in a Grid
------------------------------

In this case scan N motors through an N-dimensional rectangular grid. We'll use
the same simulated hardware as in the previous section:

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det4, motor1, motor2
    dets = [det4]   # just one in this case, but it could be more than one

We'll use a new plan, named :func:`~bluesky.plans.grid_scan`.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import grid_scan

Let's start with a 3x5 grid.

.. code-block:: python

    RE(grid_scan(dets,
                 motor1, -1.5, 1.5, 3,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5 in 3 steps
                 motor2, -0.1, 0.1, 5, False))  # scan motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1in 5

That final parameter --- ``False`` --- designates whether ``motor2`` should
"snake" back and forth along ``motor1``'s trajectory (``True``) or retread its
positions in the same direction each time (``False``), as illustrated.

.. plot::

    from bluesky.simulators import plot_raster_path
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, det
    from bluesky.plans import grid_scan
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    true_plan = grid_scan([det], motor1, -5, 5, 10, motor2, -7, 7, 15, True)
    false_plan = grid_scan([det], motor1, -5, 5, 10, motor2, -7, 7, 15, False)

    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True)
    plot_raster_path(true_plan, 'motor1', 'motor2', probe_size=.3, ax=ax1)
    plot_raster_path(false_plan, 'motor1', 'motor2', probe_size=.3, ax=ax2)
    ax1.set_title('True')
    ax2.set_title('False')
    ax1.set_xlim(-6, 6)
    ax2.set_xlim(-6, 6)

Demo:

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    from bluesky.plans import grid_scan
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, det4
    dets = [det4]

.. ipython:: python

    RE(grid_scan(dets,
                 motor1, -1.5, 1.5, 3,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5 in 3 steps
                 motor2, -0.1, 0.1, 5, False))  # scan motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1 in 5 steps

.. plot::

    from bluesky.plans import grid_scan
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, det4
    dets = [det4]
    RE(grid_scan(dets,
                 motor1, -1.5, 1.5, 3,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5 in 3 steps
                 motor2, -0.1, 0.1, 5, False))  # scan motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1 in 5 steps

The order of the motors controls how the grid is traversed. The "slowest" axis
comes first. Numpy users will appreciate that this is consistent with numpy's
convention for indexing multidimensional arrays. Since the first (slowest) axis
is only traversed once, it does not need a "snake" parameter. All subsequent
axes do. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import motor3

    # a 3 x 5 x 2 grid
    RE(grid_scan(dets,
                 motor1, -1.5, 1.5, 3,  # no snake parameter for first motor
                 motor2, -0.1, 0.1, 5, False))
                 motor3, -200, 200, 5, False))

To move motors along arbitrary trajectories instead of equally-spaced points,
use :func:`~bluesky.plans.list_grid_scan` and
:func:`~bluesky.plans.rel_list_grid_scan`.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import list_grid_scan

    RE(list_grid_scan(dets,
                      motor1, [1, 1, 2, 3, 5],
                      motor2, [25, 16, 9]))

Demo:

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   from bluesky.plans import list_grid_scan

.. ipython:: python

    RE(list_grid_scan(dets,
                      motor1, [1, 1, 2, 3, 5],
                      motor2, [25, 16, 9]))

.. plot::

    from bluesky.plans import list_grid_scan
    from ophyd.sim import det4, motor1, motor2
    dets = [det4]
    RE(list_grid_scan(dets,
                      motor1, [1, 1, 2, 3, 5],
                      motor2, [25, 16, 9]))

See :ref:`multi-dimensional_scans` to handle more specialized cases, including
combinations of :func:`~bluesky.plans.scan`-like and
:func:`~bluesky.plans.grid_scan`-like movement.

More generally, the :doc:`plans` documentation includes more exotic
trajectories, such as spirals, and plans with adaptive logic, such as
efficient peak-finders.

Aside: Access Saved Data
========================

At this point it is natural to wonder, "How do I access my saved data?"
From the point of view of *bluesky*, that's really not bluesky's concern, but
it's a reasonable question, so we'll address a typical scenario.

.. note::

    This section presumes that you are using the databroker. (We configured
    one in :ref:`an earlier section of this tutorial <databroker_setup>`.)
    You don't have to use the databroker to use bluesky; it's just
    one convenient way to capture the metadata and data generated by the
    RunEngine.

Very briefly, you can access saved data by referring to a dataset (a "run") by
its unique ID, which is returned by the RunEngine at collection time.

.. ipython:: python

    from bluesky.plans import count
    from ophyd.sim import det
    uid, = RE(count([det], num=3))
    header = db[uid]

Alternatively, perhaps more conveniently, you can access it by recency:

.. ipython:: python

    header = db[-1]  # meaning '1 run ago', i.e. the most recent run

.. note::

    We assumed above that the plan generated one "run" (dataset), which is
    typical for simple plans like :func:`~bluesky.plans.count`. In the
    *general* case, a plan can generate multiple runs, returning multiple uids,
    which in turn causes ``db`` to return a list of headers, not just one.

    .. code-block:: python

        uids = RE(some_plan(...))
        headers = db[uids]  # list of Headers

Most of the useful metadata is in this dictionary:

.. ipython:: python

    header.start

And the ("primary") stream of data is accessible like so:

.. ipython:: python

    header.table()  # return a table (a pandas.DataFrame)

From here we refer to the
`databroker tutorial <https://nsls-ii.github.io/databroker/tutorial.html>`_.

.. _tutorial_simple_customization:

Simple Customization
====================

Save Some Typing with 'Partial'
-------------------------------

Suppose we nearly always use the same detector(s) and we tire of typing out
``count([det])``. We can write a custom variant of :func:`~bluesky.plans.count`
using a built-in function provided by Python itself, :func:`functools.partial`.

.. code-block:: python

    from functools import partial
    from bluesky.plans import count
    from ophyd.sim import det

    my_count = partial(count, [det])
    RE(my_count())  # equivalent to RE(count([det]))

    # Additional arguments to my_count() are passed through to count().
    RE(my_count(num=3, delay=1))

Plans in Series
---------------

A custom plan can dispatch out to other plans using the Python syntax
``yield from``. (See :ref:`appendix <yield_from_primer>` if you want to know
why.) Examples:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import scan

    def coarse_and_fine(detectors, motor, start, stop):
        "Scan from 'start' to 'stop' in 10 steps and then again in 100 steps."
        yield from scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, 10)
        yield from scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, 100)

    RE(coarse_and_fine(dets, motor, -1, 1))

All of the plans introduced thus far, which we imported from
:mod:`bluesky.plans`, generate data sets ("runs"). Plans in the
:mod:`bluesky.plan_stubs` module do smaller operations. They can be used alone
or combined to build custom plans.

The :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.mv` plan moves one or more devices and waits for
them all to arrive.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plan_stubs import mv
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2

    # Move motor1 to 1 and motor2 to 10, simultaneously. Wait for both to arrive.
    RE(mv(motor1, 1, motor2, 10))

We can combine :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.mv` and :func:`~bluesky.plans.count`
into one plan like so:

.. code-block:: python

    def move_then_count():
        "Move motor1 and motor2 into position; then count det."
        yield from mv(motor1, 1, motor2, 10)
        yield from count(dets)

    RE(move_then_count())

It's very important to remember the ``yield from``. The following plan does
nothing at all! (The plans inside it will be *defined* but never executed.)

.. code-block:: python

    # WRONG EXAMPLE!

    def oops():
        "Forgot 'yield from'!"
        mv(motor1, 1, motor2, 10)
        count(dets)

Much richer customization is possible, but we'll leave that for a
:ref:`a later section of this tutorial <tutorial_custom_plans>`. See also the
complete list of :ref:`plan stubs <stub_plans>`.

.. warning::

    **Never put ``RE(...)`` inside a loop or a function. You should always call
    it directly --- typed by the user at the terminal --- and only once.**

    You might be tempted to write a script like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        from bluesky.plans import scan
        from ophyd.sim import motor, det

        # Don't do this!
        for j in [1, 2, 3]:
            print(j, 'steps')
            RE(scan([det], motor, 5, 10, j)))

    Or a function like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Don't do this!
        def bad_function():
            for j in [1, 2, 3]:
                print(j, 'steps')
                RE(scan([det], motor, 5, 10, j)))

    But, instead, you should do this:

    .. code-block:: python

        from bluesky.plans import scan
        from ophyd.sim import motor, det

        def good_plan():
            for j in [1, 2, 3]:
                print(j, 'steps')
                yield from scan([det], motor, 5, 10, j)

        RE(my_plan())

    If you try to hide ``RE`` inside a function, someone later might
    use that function inside another function, and now we're entering and
    exiting the RunEngine multiple times from a single prompt. This can lead
    to unexpected behavior, especially around handling interruptions and
    errors.

    To indulge a musical metaphor, the plan is the sheet music, the hardware is
    the orchestra, and the RunEngine is the conductor. There should be only
    one conductor and she needs to run whole show, start to finish.

"Baseline" Readings (and other Supplemental Data)
=================================================

In addition to the detector(s) and motor(s) of primary interest during an
experiment, it is commonly useful to take a snapshot ("baseline reading") of
other hardware. This information is typically used to check consistency over
time. ("Is the temperature of the sample mount roughly the same as it was last
week?") Ideally, we'd like to *automatically* capture readings from these
devices during all future experiments without any extra thought or typing per
experiment. Bluesky provides a specific solution for this.

Configure
---------

.. note::

    If you are visiting user at a facility that runs bluesky, you may not need
    to do this configuration, and you can skip the next subsection just below
    --- :ref:`choose_baseline_devices`.

    You can type ``sd`` to check. If you get something like:

    .. ipython::
        :verbatim:

        In [1]: sd
        Out[1]: SupplementalData(baseline=[], monitors=[], flyers=[])

    you should skip this configuration.

Before we begin, we have to do a little more RunEngine configuration, like what
we did in the :ref:`tutorial_run_engine_setup` section with ``RE.subscribe``.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.preprocessors import SupplementalData

    sd = SupplementalData()
    RE.preprocessors.append(sd)

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    from bluesky.preprocessors import SupplementalData
    sd = SupplementalData()
    RE.preprocessors.append(sd)

.. _choose_baseline_devices:

Choose "Baseline" Devices
-------------------------

We'll choose the detectors/motors that we want to be read automatically at the
beginning and end of each dataset ("run"). If you are using a shared
configuration, this also might already have been done, so you should check the
content of ``sd.baseline`` before altering it.

.. ipython:: python

    sd.baseline  # currently empty

Suppose that we want to take baseline readings from three detectors and two
motors. We'll import a handful of simulated devices for this purpose, put them
into a list, and assign ``sd.baseline``.

.. ipython:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det1, det2, det3, motor1, motor2
    sd.baseline = [det1, det2, det3, motor1, motor2]

Notice that we can put a mixture of detectors and motors in this list. It
doesn't matter to bluesky that some are movable and some are not because it's
just going to be *reading* them, and both detectors and motors can be read.

Use
---

Now we can just do a scan with the detector and motor of primary interest. The
RunEngine will automatically take baseline readings before and after each run.
Demo:

.. ipython:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    from bluesky.plans import scan
    RE(scan([det], motor, -1, 1, 5))

We can clear or update the list of baseline detectors at any time.

.. ipython:: python

    sd.baseline = []

As an aside, this is one place where the design of bluesky really pays off. By
separating the executor (the RunEngine) from the instruction sets (the plans)
it's easy to apply global configuration without updating every plan
individually.

Access Baseline Data
--------------------

If you access the data from our baseline scan, you might think that the
baseline data is missing!

.. ipython:: python

    header = db[-1]
    header.table()

Looking again at the output when we executed this scan, notice these lines:

.. code-block:: none

    New stream: 'baseline'
    ...
    New stream: 'primary'

By default, ``header.table()`` gives us the "primary" data stream:

.. ipython:: python

    header.table('primary')  # same result as header.table()

We can access other streams by name.

.. ipython:: python

    header.table('baseline')

A list of the stream names in a given run is available as
``header.stream_names``. From here we refer to the
`databroker tutorial <https://nsls-ii.github.io/databroker/tutorial.html>`_.

Other Supplemental Data
-----------------------

Above, we used ``sd.baseline``. There is also ``sd.monitors`` for signals to
monitor asynchronously during a run and ``sd.flyers`` for devices to "fly-scan"
during a run. See :ref:`supplemental_data` for details.

.. _tutorial_pause_resume_suspend:

Pause, Resume, Suspend
======================

Interactive Pause & Resume
--------------------------

Sometimes it is convenient to pause data collection, check on some things, and
then either resume from where you left off or quit. The RunEngine makes it
possible to do this cleanly and safely on *any* plan, including user-defined
plans, with minimal effort by the user. Of course, experiments on systems
that evolve with time can't be arbitrarily paused and resumed. It's up to the
user to know that and use this feature only when applicable.

Take this example, a step scan over ten points.

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    from bluesky.plans import scan

    motor.delay = 1  # simulate slow motor movement
    RE(scan([det], motor, 1, 10, 10))

Demo:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: RE(scan([det], motor, 1, 10, 10))
    Transient Scan ID: 1     Time: 2018/02/12 12:40:36
    Persistent Unique Scan ID: 'c5db9bb4-fb7f-49f4-948b-72fb716d1f67'

    |         3 | 12:40:39.7 |      3.000 |      0.011 |

At this point we decide to hit **Ctrl+C** (SIGINT). The RunEngine will catch
this signal and react like so. We will examine this output piece by piece.

.. code-block:: none

    ^C
    A 'deferred pause' has been requested.The RunEngine will pause at the next
    checkpoint. To pause immediately, hit Ctrl+C again in the next 10 seconds.

    RunEngineInterrupted:
    Your RunEngine is entering a paused state. These are your options for changing
    the state of the RunEngine:
    RE.resume()    Resume the plan.
    RE.abort()     Perform cleanup, then kill plan. Mark exit_stats='aborted'.
    RE.stop()      Perform cleanup, then kill plan. Mark exit_status='success'.
    RE.halt()      Emergency Stop: Do not perform cleanup --- just stop.

When it pauses, the RunEngine immediately tells all Devices that it has touched
so far to "stop". (Devices define what that means to them in their ``stop()``
method.) This is not a replacement for proper equipment protection; it is just
a convenience.

Now, at our leisure, we may:

* pause to think
* investigate the state of our hardware, such as the detector's exposure time
* turn on more verbose logging  (see :doc:`debugging`)
* decide whether to stop here or resume

Suppose we decide to resume. The RunEngine will pick up from the last
"checkpoint". Typically, this means beginning of each step in a scan, but
plans may specify checkpoints anywhere they like.

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [13]: RE.resume()
    |         5 | 12:40:50.1 |      5.000 |      0.000 |

    generator scan ['c5db9bb4'] (scan num: 1)

The scan has completed successfully.

If you go back and read the output from when we hit Ctrl+C, you will notice
that the RunEngine didn't pause immediately: it finished the current step of
the scan first. Quoting an excerpt from the demo above:

.. code-block:: none

    ^C
    A 'deferred pause' has been requested.The RunEngine will pause at the next
    checkpoint. To pause immediately, hit Ctrl+C again in the next 10 seconds.

    |         4 | 12:40:40.7 |      4.000 |      0.000 |
    Pausing...

Observe that hitting Ctrl+C *twice* pauses immediately, without waiting to
finish the current step.

.. code-block:: none

    ^C^C
    Pausing...

When resumed, the RunEngine will *rewind* to the last checkpoint (the beginning
of the fourth step in the scan) and repeat instructions as needed.

Quoting again from the demo, notice that ``RE.resume()`` was only one of our
options. If we decide not to continue we can quit in three different ways:

.. code-block:: none

    Your RunEngine is entering a paused state. These are your options for changing
    the state of the RunEngine:
    RE.resume()    Resume the plan.
    RE.abort()     Perform cleanup, then kill plan. Mark exit_stats='aborted'.
    RE.stop()      Perform cleanup, then kill plan. Mark exit_status='success'.
    RE.halt()      Emergency Stop: Do not perform cleanup --- just stop.

"Aborting" and "stopping" are almost the same thing: they just record different
metadata about why the experiment was ended. Both signal to the plan that it
should end early, but they still let it specify more instructions so that it
can "clean up." For example, a :func:`~bluesky.plans.rel_scan` moves the motor
back to its starting position before quitting.

In rare cases, if we are worried that the plan's cleanup procedure might be
dangerous, we can "halt". Halting circumvents the cleanup instructions.

Try executing ``RE(scan([det], motor, 1, 10, 10))``, pausing, and exiting in
these various ways. Observe that the RunEngine won't let you run a new plan
until you have resolved the paused plan using one of these methods.

Automated Suspend & Resume
--------------------------

The RunEngine can be configured in advance to *automatically* pause and resume
in response to external signals. To distinguish automatic pause/resume from
interactive, user-initiated pause and resume, we call this behavior
"suspending."

For details, see :ref:`suspenders`.

.. _tutorial_metadata:

Metadata
========

If users pass extra keyword arguments to ``RE``, they are interpreted as
metadata

.. code-block:: python

    RE(count([det]), user='Dan', mood='skeptical')
    RE(count([det]), user='Dan', mood='optimistic')

and they can be used for searching later:

.. code-block:: python

    headers = db(user='Dan')
    headers = db(mood='skeptical')

Metadata can also be added *persistently* (i.e. applied to all future runs
until removed) by editing the dictionary ``RE.md``.

.. code-block:: python

    RE.md
    RE.md['user'] = 'Dan'

No need to specify ``user`` every time now....

.. code-block:: python

    RE(count([det]))  # automatically includes user='Dan'

The key can be temporarily overridden:

.. code-block:: python

    RE(count([det]), user='Tom')  # overrides the setting in RE.md, just once

or deleted:

.. code-block:: python

    del RE.md['user']

In addition to any user-provided metadata, the RunEngine, the devices, and the
plan capture some metadata automatically. For more see, :doc:`metadata`.

Simulate and Introspect Plans
=============================

We have referred to a *plan* as a "sequence of instructions encoding an
experimental procedure." But what's inside a plan really? Bluesky calls each
atomic instruction inside a plan a *message*.  Handling the messages directly
is only necessary when debugging or doing unusually deep customization, but
it's helpful to see them at least once before moving on to more practical
tools.

Try printing out every message in a couple simple plans:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import count
    from ophyd.sim import det

    for msg in count([]):
        print(msg)

    for msg in count([det]):
        print(msg)

See the :doc:`msg` section for more.

Bluesky includes some tools for producing more useful, human-readable summaries
to answer the question, "What will this plan do?"

.. ipython:: python

    from bluesky.simulators import summarize_plan
    from bluesky.plans import count, rel_scan
    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    # Count a detector 3 times.
    summarize_plan(count([det], 3))
    # A 3-step scan.
    summarize_plan(rel_scan([det], motor, -1, 1, 3))

For more possibilities, see :doc:`simulation`.

.. _tutorial_device:

Devices
=======

Theory
------

The notion of a "Device" serves two goals:

* Provide a **standard interface** to all hardware for the sake of generality
  and code reuse.
* **Logically group** individual signals into composite "Devices" that can be
  read together, as a unit, and configured in a coordinated way. Provide a
  human-readable name to this group, with an eye toward later data analysis.

In bluesky's view of the world, there are only three different kinds of devices
used in data acquisition.

* Some devices can be **read**. This includes simple points detectors that
  produce a single number and large CCD detectors that produce big arrays.
* Some devices can be both **read and set**. Setting a motor physically moves
  it to a new position. Setting a temperature controller impels it to gradually
  change its temperature. Setting the exposure time on some detector promptly
  updates its configuration.
* Some devices produce data at a rate too high to be read out in real time, and
  instead **buffer their data externally** in separate hardware or software
  until it can be read out.

Bluesky interacts with all devices via a :doc:`specified interface <hardware>`.
Each device is represented by a Python object with certain methods and
attributes (with names like ``read`` and ``set``). Some of these methods are
asynchronous, such as ``set``, which allows for the concurrent movement of
multiple devices.

Implementation
--------------

`Ophyd <https://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd>`_, a Python library that was
developed in tandem with bluesky, implements this interface for devices that
speak `EPICS <http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/>`_. But bluesky is not tied to
ophyd or EPICS specifically: any Python object may be used, so long as it
provides the specified methods and attributes that bluesky expects. For
example, an experimental implementation of the bluesky interface for LabView
has been written. And the simulated hardware that we have been using in this
tutorial is all based on pure-Python constructs unconnected from hardware or
any specific hardware control protocol.

To get a flavor for what it looks like to configure hardware in ophyd,
connecting to an EPICS motor looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd import EpicsMotor

    nano_top_x = EpicsMotor('XF:31ID-ES{Dif:Nano-Ax:TopX}Mtr', name='nano_top_x')

We have provided both the machine-readable address of the motor on the network,
``'XF:31ID-ES{Dif:Nano-Ax:TopX}Mtr'`` (in EPICS jargon, the "PV" for
"Process Variable"), and a human-readable name, ``'nano_top_x'``, which will be
used to label the data generated by this motor. When it comes time to analyze
the data, we will be grateful to be dealing with the human-readable label.

The ``EpicsMotor`` device is a logical grouping of many signals. The most
important are the readback (actual position) and setpoint (target position).
All of the signals are summarized thus. The details here aren't important at
this stage: the take-away message is, "There is a lot of stuff to keep track of
about a motor, and a Device helpfully groups that stuff for us."

.. _tutorial_custom_plans:

Write Custom Plans
==================

As mentioned in the :ref:`tutorial_simple_customization` section above, the
"pre-assembled" plans with :func:`~bluesky.plans.count` and
:func:`~bluesky.plans.scan` are built from smaller "plan stubs". We can
mix and match the "stubs" and/or "pre-assembled" plans to build custom plans.

There are many of plan stubs, so it's convenient to import the whole module and
work with that.

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.plan_stubs as bps

Move in Parallel
----------------

Before writing a custom plan to coordinate the motion of multiple devices,
consider whether your use case could be addressed with one of the built-in
:ref:`multi-dimensional_scans`.

We previously introduced the :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.mv` plan that moves one
or more devices and waits for them all to arrive. There is also
:func:`~bluesky.plans.mvr` for moving *relative* to the current position.

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2

    # Move motor1 to 1 and motor2 10 units in the positive direction relative
    # to their current positions. Wait for both to arrive.
    RE(bps.mvr(motor1, 1, motor2, 10))

Some scenarios require more low-level control over when the waiting occurs.
For these, we employ :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.wait` and
:func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.abs_set` ("absolute set") or
:func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.rel_set` ("relative set").

Here is a scenario that does require a custom solution: we want to set several
motors in motion at once, including multiple fast motors and one slow motor. We
want to wait for the fast motors to arrive, print a message, then wait for the
slow motor to arrive, and print a second message.

.. code-block:: python

    def staggered_wait(fast_motors, slow_motor):
        # Start all the motors, fast and slow, moving at once.
        # Put all the fast_motors in one group...
        for motor in fast_motors:
            yield from bps.abs_set(motor, 5, group='A')
        # ...but put the slow motor is separate group.
        yield from bps.abs_set(slow_motor, 5, group='B')

        # Wait for all the fast motors.
        print('Waiting on the fast motors.')
        yield from bps.wait('A')
        print('Fast motors are in place. Just waiting on the slow one now.')

        # Then wait for the slow motor.
        yield from bps.wait('B')
        print('Slow motor is in place.')

Sleeping (Timed Delays)
-----------------------

.. note::

    If you need to wait for your motor to finish moving, temperature to finish
    equilibrating, or shutter to finish opening, inserting delays into plans
    isn't the best way to do that. It should be the *Device's* business to
    report accurately when it is done, including any extra padding for settling
    or equilibration. On some devices, such as ``EpicsMotor``, this can be
    configured like ``motor.settle_time = 3``.

For timed delays, bluesky has a special plan, which allows the RunEngine to
continue its business during the sleep.

.. code-block:: python

    def sleepy_plan(motor, positions):
        "Step a motor through a list of positions with 1-second delays between steps.")
        for position in positions:
            yield from bps.mv(motor, position)
            yield from bps.sleep(1)

**You should always use this plan, *never* Python's built-in function
:func:`time.sleep`.** Why?
The RunEngine uses an event loop to concurrently manage many tasks. It assumes
that none of those tasks blocks for very long. (A good figure for "very long"
is 0.2 seconds.) Therefore, you should never incorporate long blocking function
calls in your plan, such as ``time.sleep(1)``.

    def one_run_multi_events(detectors, num):
        yield from bps.open_run()
        for i in range(num):
            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)
        yield from bps.close_run()
    def multi_runs_multi_events(detectors, num, num_runs):
        for i in range(num_runs):
            yield from one_run_multi_events(detectors, num)

Any plan that generates data must include instructions for grouping readings
into *Events* (i.e. rows in a table) and grouping those Events into *Runs*
(datasets that are given a "scan ID"). This is best explained by example.

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.plan_stubs as bps

    def one_run_one_event(detectors):
        # Declare the beginning of a new run.
        yield from bps.open_run()

        # Trigger each detector and wait for triggering to complete.
        # Then read the detectors and bundle these readings into an Event
        # (i.e. one row in a table.)
        yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)

        # Declare the end of the run.
        yield from bps.close_run()

Execute the plan like so:

.. ipython:: python

    RE(one_run_one_event([det1, det2]))

We observe:

* one table (one Run)
* one row (one Event)
* two columns (a column for each detector)

Here's the same plan again, with :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.trigger_and_read`
moved inside a for loop.

.. code-block:: python

    def one_run_multi_events(detectors, num):
        yield from bps.open_run()

        for i in range(num):
            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)

        yield from bps.close_run()

Execute the plan like so:

.. ipython:: python

    RE(one_run_multi_events([det1, det2], 3))

We observe:

* one table (one Run)
* three rows (three Events)
* two columns (a column for each detector)

Finally, add another loop re-using ``one_run_multi_events`` inside that loop.

.. code-block:: python

    def multi_runs_multi_events(detectors, num, num_runs):
        for i in range(num_runs):
            yield from one_run_multi_events(detectors, num)

.. ipython:: python

    RE(multi_runs_multi_events([det1, det2], num=3, num_runs=2))

We observe:

* two tables (two Runs)
* three rows (three Events)
* two columns (a column for each detector)

We also notice that the return value output from the RunEngine is a tuple with
two unique IDs, one per Run generated by this plan.

In order to focus on the scope of an Event and a Run, we have left out an
important detail, addressed in the next section, which may be necessary to
incorporate before trying these plans on real devices.

Stage and Unstage
-----------------

Complex devices often require some preliminary setup before they can be used
for data collection, moving them from a resting state into a state where they
are ready to acquire data. Bluesky accommodates this in a general way by
allowing every Device to implement an optional ``stage()`` method, with a
corresponding ``unstage()`` method. Plans should stage every device that they
touch exactly once and unstage every device at the end. If a Device does not
have a ``stage()`` method the RunEngine will just skip over it.

Revising our simplest example above, ``one_run_one_event``,

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.plan_stubs as bps

    def one_run_one_event(detectors):
        yield from bps.open_run()
        yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)
        yield from bps.close_run()

we incorporate staging like so:

.. code-block:: python

    def one_run_one_event(detectors):

        # 'Stage' every device.
        for det in detectors:
            yield from bps.stage(det)

        yield from bps.open_run()
        yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)
        yield from bps.close_run()

        # 'Unstage' every device.
        for det in detectors:
            yield from bps.unstage(det)

This is starting to get verbose. At this point, we might want to accept some
additional complexity in exchange for brevity --- and some assurance that we
don't forget to use these plans in matching pairs. To that end, this plan is
equivalent:

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.preprocessors as bpp

    def one_run_one_event(detectors):

        @bpp.stage_decorator(detectors)
        def inner():
            yield from bps.open_run()
            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)
            yield from bps.close_run()

        return (yield from inner())

The :func:`~bluesky.preprocessors.stage_decorator` is a *plan preprocessor*, a
plan which consumes another plan and modifies its instructions. In this case,
it adds inserts 'stage' and 'unstage' messages, supplanting
:func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.stage` and :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.unstage`. We
can trim the verbosity down yet more by employing
:func:`~bluesky.preprocessors.run_decorator`, supplanting
:func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.open_run` and :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.close_run`.
The result:

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.preprocessors as bpp

    def one_run_one_event(detectors):

        @bpp.stage_decorator(detectors)
        @bpp.run_decorator()
        def inner():
            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)

        return (yield from inner())

Incidentally, recall that we have already encountered a preprocessor in this
tutorial, in the section on baseline readings.
:class:`~bluesky.preprocessors.SupplementalData` is a preprocessor.

.. _tutorial_plan_metadata:

Add Metadata
------------

To make it easier to search for data generated by the plan and to inspect what
was done afterward, we should include some metadata. We create a dictionary and
pass it to :func:`~bluesky.preprocessors.run_decorator` (or, in the more
verbose formulation, to :func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.open_run`). The RunEngine
will combine this metadata with any information provided by the user, as shown
in the :ref:`the earlier section on metadata <tutorial_metadata>`.

.. code-block:: python

    def one_run_one_event(detectors):

        md = {
            # Human-friendly names of detector Devices (useful for searching)
            'detectors': [det.name for det in detectors],

            # The Python 'repr's each argument to the plan
            'plan_args': {'detectors': list(map(repr, detectors))},

            # The name of this plan
            'plan_name': 'one_run_one_event',
        }

        @bpp.stage_decorator(detectors)
        @bpp.run_decorator(md)
        def inner():
            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)

        return (yield from inner())

.. warning::

    The values in the metadata dictionary must be strings, numbers,
    lists/arrays, or dictionaries only. Metadata cannot contain arbitrary
    Python types because downstream consumers (like databases) do not know what
    to do with those and will error.

To be polite, we should allow the user to override this metadata. All of
bluesky's "pre-assembled" plans (:func:`~bluesky.plans.count`,
:func:`~bluesky.plans.scan`, etc.) provide an optional ``md`` argument for this
purpose, implemented like so:

.. code-block:: python

    def one_run_one_event(detectors, md=None):

        _md = {
            'detectors': [det.name for det in detectors],
            'plan_args': {'detectors': list(map(repr, detectors))},
            'plan_name': 'one_run_one_event',
        }

        # If a key exists in md, it overwrites the default in _md.
        _md.update(md or {})

        @bpp.stage_decorator(detectors)
        @bpp.run_decorator(_md)
        def inner():
            yield from bps.trigger_and_read(detectors)

        return (yield from inner())

Add "Hints" in Metadata
-----------------------

The metadata dictionary may optionally include a key named ``'hints'``. This
key has special significance to the
:class:`~bluesky.callback.best_effort.BestEffortCallback` and potentially
other downstream consumers, which use it to try to infer useful ways to
present the data. Currently, it solves two specific problems.

1. Narrow the potentially large set of readings to a manageable number of most
   important ones that fit into a table.
2. Identify the dimensionality of the data (1D scan? 2D grid? N-D grid?) and
   the dependent and independent parameters, for visualization and peak-fitting
   purposes.

It's up to each device to address (1). The plan has no role in that.
Each device has an optional ``hints`` attribute with a value like
``{'fields': [...]}`` to answer the question, "Of all the readings you
produce, what are the names of the most important ones?"

We need the plan to help us with (2). Only the plan can sort out which devices
are being employed as "independent" axes and which are being measured as
dependent variables. This isn't clear just from looking at the Devices alone
because any given movable device can be used as an axis or as a "detector"
depending on the context --- ``count([motor])`` is a perfectly valid thing to
do!

The schema of the plan's hint metadata is:

.. code-block:: python

    {'dimensions': [([<FIELD>, ...], <STREAM_NAME>),
                    ([<FIELD>, ...], <STREAM_NAME>),
                    ...
                   ]}

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # a 1-D scan over x
    {'dimensions': [(['x'], 'primary')]}

    # a 2-D grid_scan over x and y
    {'dimensions': [(['x'], 'primary'),
                    (['y'], 'primary')]}

    # a scan moving x and y together along a diagonal
    {'dimensions': [(['x', 'y'], 'primary')]}

    # a 1-D scan over temperature, represented in C and K units
    {'dimensions': [(['C', 'K'], 'primary')]}

    # a 1-D scan over energy, as measured in energy and diffractometer position
    {'dimensions': [(['E', 'dcm'], 'primary')]}

    # special case: a sequence of readings where the independent axis is just time
    {'dimensions': [(['time'], 'primary')]}

Each entry in the outer list represents one independent dimension. A dimension
might be represented by multiple fields, either from different devices moved in
a coordinated fashion by the plan (``['x', 'y']``), presented as fully redundant
information from one device (``['C', 'K']``), or coupled information from two
sub-devices (``['E', 'dcm']``).

The second element in each entry is the stream name: ``'primary'`` in every
example above.  This should correspond to the ``name`` passed into
:func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.trigger_and_read` or
:func:`~bluesky.plan_stubs.create` inside the plan. The default name is
``primary``.

Putting it all together, the plan asks the device(s) being used as independent
axes for their important field(s) and builds a list of dimensions like so:

.. code-block:: python

   dimensions = [(motor.hints['fields'], 'primary')]

We must account for the fact that ``hints`` is optional. A given Device
might not have a ``hints`` attribute at all and, even if it does, the
hints might not contain the ``'fields'`` key that we are interested in. This
pattern silently omits the dimensions hint if the necessary information is not
provided by the Device:

.. code-block:: python

    def scan(..., md=None):
        _md = {...}
        _md.update(md or {})

        try:
            dimensions = [(motor.hints['fields'], 'primary')]
        except (AttributeError, KeyError):
            pass
        else:
            _md['hints'].setdefault('dimensions', dimensions)

        ...

Finally, by using ``setdefault``, we have allowed user to override these hints
if they know better by passing in ``scan(..., md={'hints': ...})``.

.. _tutorial_adaptive:

Adaptive Logic in a Plan
------------------------

Two-way communication is possible between the generator and the RunEngine.
For example, the :func:`~trigger_and_read` plan responds with its readings. We
can use it to make an on-the-fly decision about whether to continue or stop.

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.preprocessors as bpp
    import bluesky.plan_stubs as bps
    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    def conditional_break(threshold):
        """Set, trigger, read until the detector reads intensity < threshold"""

        @bpp.stage_decorator([det, motor])
        @bpp.run_decorator()
        def inner():
            i = 0
            while True:
                yield from bps.mv(motor, i)
                readings = yield from bps.trigger_and_read([det])
                if readings['det']['value'] < threshold:
                    break
                i += 1
        return (yield from inner())

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    import bluesky.preprocessors as bpp
    import bluesky.plan_stubs as bps
    from bluesky import Msg
    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    def conditional_break(threshold):
        def inner():
            i = 0
            while True:
                yield from bps.mv(motor, i)
                readings = yield from bps.trigger_and_read([det])
                if readings['det']['value'] < threshold:
                    break
                i += 1
        # Decorators do not work in IPython sphinx directive!
        # Using wrapper instead...
        return (yield from bpp.stage_wrapper(bpp.run_wrapper(inner()), [det, motor]))

Demo:

.. ipython:: python

    RE(conditional_break(0.2))

The important line in this example is

.. code-block:: python

    reading = yield from bps.trigger_and_read([det])

The action proceeds like this:

1. The plan yields a 'read' message to the RunEngine.
2. The RunEngine reads the detector.
3. The RunEngine sends that reading *back to the plan*, and that response is
   assigned to the variable ``reading``.

The response, ``reading``, is formatted like:

.. code-block:: python

     {<name>: {'value': <value>, 'timestamp': <timestamp>}, ...}

For a detailed technical description of the messages and their responses,
see :ref:`msg`.

.. _tutorial_exception_handling:

Plan "Cleanup" (Exception Handling)
-----------------------------------

If an exception is raised, the RunEngine gives the plan the opportunity to
catch the exception and either handle it or merely yield some "clean up"
messages before re-raising the exception and killing plan execution. (Recall
this from :ref:`tutorial_pause_resume_suspend` above.)

This is the general idea:

.. code-block:: python

    # This example is illustrative, but it is not completely correct.
    # Use `finalize_wrapper` instead (or read its source code).

    def plan_with_cleanup():
        def main_plan():
            # do stuff...

        def cleanup_plan():
            # do other stuff...

        try:
            yield from main_plan()
        finally:
            # Do this even if an Exception is raised.
            yield from cleanup_plan()

The exception in question may originate from the plan itself or from the
RunEngine when it attempts to execute a given command.

The :func:`~bluesky.preprocessors.finalize_wrapper` preprocessor provides a
succinct and fully correct way of applying this general pattern.

.. code-block:: python

    import bluesky.preprocessors as bpp

    def plan_with_cleanup():
        yield from bpp.finalize_wrapper(main_plan(), cleanup_plan())
