Recording Metadata
==================

Capturing useful metadata is the main objective of bluesky. The more
information you can provide and what you are doing and why you are doing it,
the more useful bluesky and downstream data search and analysis tools can be.

When the RunEngine executes a plan, it attaches metadata to the data it
collects. It captures metadata that has been:

1. entered interactively by the user at execution time
2. provided in the code of the *plan*
3. automatically inferred
4. entered by user once and stashed for reuse on all future plans

If there is a conflict between these sources, the first entry in this list
wins.

1. Interactively, for One Use
-----------------------------

Suppose we are executing some custom plan called ``plan``.

.. code-block:: python

    RE(plan())

If we give artibrary extra keyword arguments, they will be interpreted as
metadata.

.. code-block:: python

    RE(plan(), sample_id='A', purpose='calibration', operator='Dan')

The run(s) --- i.e., datasets --- generated by ``plan()`` will include the
custom metadata:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    'sample_id': 'A',
    'purpose': 'calibration'.
    'operator': 'Dan',
    ...

If ``plan`` generates more that one run, all the runs will get this metadata.
For example, this plan generates three different runs.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import count, scan
    from bluesky.examples det1, det2, motor  # simulated detectors, motor

    def plan():
        yield from count([det])
        yield from scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5)
        yield from count([det])

If executed as above:

.. code-block:: python

    RE(plan(), sample_id='A', purpose='calibration', operator='Dan')

each run will get a copy of the sample_id, purpose and operator metadata.

2. Through a plan
-----------------

Revisiting the previous example:

.. code-block:: python

    def plan():
        yield from count([det])
        yield from scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5)
        yield from count([det])

we can pass different metadata for each run. Every
:ref:`built-in pre-assembled plan <preassembled_plans>` accepts a parameter
``md``, which you can use to inject metadata that applies only to that plan.

.. code-block:: python

    def plan():
        yield from count([det], md={purpose: 'calibration'})
        yield from scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5, md={'purpose': 'good data'})
        yield from count([det], md={'purpose': 'sanity check'})

The metadata passed into ``RE`` is combined with the metadata passed in to each
plan. Thus, calling

.. code-block:: python

    RE(plan(), sample_id='A', operator='Dan')

generates these three sets of metadata:

.. code-block:: python

    # one
    ...
    'sample_id': 'A',
    'purpose': 'calibration'.
    'operator': 'Dan',
    ...

    # two
    ...
    'sample_id': 'A',
    'purpose': 'good data'.
    'operator': 'Dan',
    ...

    # three
    ...
    'sample_id': 'A',
    'purpose': 'sanity check'.
    'operator': 'Dan',
    ...

If there is a conflict, ``RE`` keywords takes precedence. So

.. code-block:: python

    RE(plan(), purpose='test')

would override the individual 'purpose' metadata from the plan, marking all
three as purpose=test.

For more on injecting metadata via plans, refer to :ref:`customizing_metadata`.

.. note::

    All of the built-in plans provide certain metadata automatically. Custom
    plans are not *required* to provide any of this, but it is a nice pattern
    to follow.

    * plan_name --- e.g., ``'scan'``
    * detectors --- a list of the names of the detectors
    * motors --- a list of the names of the motors
    * plan_args --- dict of keyword arguments passed to the plan
    * plan_pattern -- function used to create the trajectory
    * plan_pattern_module --- Python module where ``plan_pattern`` is defined
    * plan_pattern_args --- dict of keyword arguments passed to
      ``plan_pattern`` to create the trajectory

    The ``plan_name`` and ``plan_args`` together should provide sufficient
    information to recreate the plan. The ``detectors`` and ``motors`` are
    convenient keys to search on later.

    The ``plan_pattern*`` entries provide lower-level, more explicit
    information about the *trajectory* ("pattern") generated by the plan,
    separate from the specific detectors and motors involved. For complex
    trajectories like spirals, this is especially useful. As a simple example,
    here is the pattern-related metadata for :func:`scan`.

    .. code-block:: python

        ...
        'plan_pattern': 'linspace',
        'plan_pattern_module': 'numpy',
        'plan_pattern_args': dict(start=start, stop=stop, numnum)
        ...

    Thus, one can re-create the "pattern" (trajectory) like so:

    .. code-block:: python

        numpy.linspace(**dict(start=start, stop=stop, numnum))

3. Automatically
----------------

*This section is probably only useful to developers. If you are user just
trying to enter metadata, skip to the next section.*

For each run, the RunEngine automatically records:

* 'time' --- In this context, the start time. (Other times are also recorded.)
* 'uid' --- a globally unique ID for this run
* 'plan_name' --- the function or class name of ``plan`` (e.g., 'count')
* 'plan_type'--- e.g., the Python type of ``plan`` (e.g., 'generator')

The last two can be overridden by any of the methods above. The first two
cannot be overridden by the user.

.. note::

    If some custom plan does not specify a 'plan_name' and 'plan_type', the
    RunEngine infers them as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        plan_name = type(plan).__name__
        plan_type = getattr(plan, '__name__', '')

    These may be more or less informative depending on what ``plan`` is. They
    are just heuristics to provide *some* information by default if the plan
    itself and the user do not provide it.

4. Interactively, for Repeated Use
----------------------------------

Each time a plan is executed, the current contents of ``RE.md`` are copied into
the metadata for all runs generated by the plan.  To enter metadata once to
reuse on all plans, add it to ``RE.md``.

.. code-block:: python

    RE.md['proposal_id'] = 123456
    RE.md['project'] = 'flying cars'
    RE.md['dimensions'] = (5, 3, 10)

View its current contents,

.. code-block:: python

    RE.md

delete a key you want to stop using,

.. code-block:: python

    del RE.md['project']   # delete a key

or use any of the standard methods that apply to dictionaries in Python.

The ``scan_id``, an integer that the RunEngine automatically increments at the
beginnging of each scan, is stored in ``RE.md['scan_id']``.

.. warning::

    Clearing all keys, like so:

    .. code-block:: python

        RE.md.clear()  # clear *all* keys

    will reset the ``scan_id``. The next time a plan is executed, the
    RunEngine will start with a ``scan_id`` of 1 and set

    .. code-block:: python

        RE.md['scan_id'] = 1

    Some readers may prefer to reset the scan ID to 1 at the beginning of a new
    experiment; others way wish to maintain a single unbroken sequence of scan
    IDs forever.

    From a technical standpoint, it is fine to have duplicate scan IDs. All
    runs also have randomly-generated 'uid' ("unique ID") which is globally
    unique forever.

Persistence Between Sessions
----------------------------

We provide way to persist the contents of the metadata stash ``RE.md`` between
sessions (e.g., exiting and re-opening IPython).

In general, the ``RE.md`` attribute may be an ordinary Python dictionary or
anything that supports the dictionary interface. To persist metadata between
sessions, bluesky uses ``HistoryDict`` --- a Python dictionary backed by a
sqlite database file. Any changes made to ``RE.md`` are synced to the file
before IPython exits.

The easiest way to create a ``HistoryDict`` to use the convenience function,
``get_history``. It searches for a pre-existing history file in one of several
standard locations and, if it doesn't find one, it creates a new one.  (See the
``get_history`` documentation below for details.)

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.utils import get_history
    RE = RunEngine(get_history())

Alternatively, create a ``HistoryDict`` manually anywhere you please:

.. code-block:: python

    from historydict import HistoryDict
    h = HistoryDict('your/path/here')
    RE = RunEngine(h)

.. autofunction:: bluesky.utils.get_history

See also the
`historydict documentation <https://github.com/Nikea/historydict#historydict>`_.

Allowed Data Types
------------------

Custom metadata keywords can be mapped to:

* strings --- e.g., ``task='calibration'``
* numbers --- e.g., ``attempt=5``
* lists or tuples --- e.g., ``dimensions=[1, 3]``
* (nested) dictionaries --- e.g., ``dimensions={'width': 1, 'height': 3}``


Special Fields
--------------

Arbitrary custom fields are allowed --- you can invent any names that are
useful to you.

But certain fields are given special significance by bluesky's document model,
and are either disallowed are required to be a certain type.

The fields:

* **owner**
* **group**
* **project**
  
are optional but, to facilitate searchability, if they are not blank they must
be strings. A non-string, like ``owner=5`` will produce an error that will
interrupt scan execution immediately after it starts.

Similarly, the keyword **sample** has special significance. It must be either a
string or a dictionary.

The **scan_id** field is expected to be an integer, and it is automatically
incremented between runs. If a scan_id is not provided by the user or stashed
in the persistent metadata from the previous run, it defaults to 1.

The fields:

* **uid**
* **time**

are reserved by the document model and cannot be set by the user.

Required Fields
---------------

In current versions of bluesky, **no fields are universally required by bluesky
itself**. It is possible specify your own required fields in local
configuration. See :ref:`md_validator`. (At NSLS-II, there are facility-wide
requirements coming soon.)

.. _md_validator:

Metadata Validator
------------------

Additional, customized metadata validation can be added to the RunEngine.
For example, to ensure that a run will not be executed unless the parameter
'sample_number' is specified, define a function that accepts a dictionary
argument and raises if 'sample_number' is not found.

.. code-block:: python

    def ensure_sample_number(md):
        if 'sample_number' not in md:
            raise ValueError("You forgot the sample number.")

Apply this function by setting

.. code-block:: python

    RE.md_validator = ensure_sample_number

The function will be executed immediately before each new run in opened.
