Plans
=====

A *plan* is bluesky's concept of an experimental procedure. A plan may be any
iterable object (list, tuple, custom iterable class, ...) but most commonly it
is implemented as a Python generator. For a more technical discussion we refer
you :doc:`msg`.

A variety of pre-assembled plans are provided. Like sandwiches on a deli menu,
you can use our pre-assembled plans or assemble your own from the same
ingredients, catalogued under the heading :ref:`stub_plans` below.

.. note::

    In the examples that follow, we will assume that you have a RunEngine
    instance named ``RE``. This may have already been configured for you if you
    are a user at a facility that runs bluesky. See
    :ref:`this section of the tutorial <tutorial_run_engine_setup>` to sort out
    if you already have a RunEngine and to quickly make one if needed.

Time series ("count")
---------------------

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det
    from bluesky.plans import count

    # a single reading of the detector 'det'
    RE(count([det]))

    # five consecutive readings
    RE(count([det], num=5))

    # five sequential readings separated by a 1-second delay
    RE(count([det], num=5, delay=1))

    # a variable delay
    RE(count([det], num=5, delay=[1, 2, 3, 4]))

    # Take readings forever, until interrupted (e.g., with Ctrl+C)
    RE(count([det], num=None))

.. code-block:: python

    # We'll use the 'noisy_det' example detector for a more interesting plot.
    from ophyd.sim import noisy_det

    RE(count([noisy_det], num=5))


.. plot::

    from bluesky import RunEngine
    from bluesky.plans import count
    from ophyd.sim import noisy_det
    from bluesky.callbacks.best_effort import BestEffortCallback
    bec = BestEffortCallback()
    RE = RunEngine({})
    RE.subscribe(bec)
    RE(count([noisy_det], num=5))

.. note::

   Why doesn't :func:`count` have an ``exposure_time`` parameter?

   Modern CCD detectors typically parametrize exposure time with *multiple*
   parameters (acquire time, acquire period, num exposures, ...) as do scalers
   (preset time, auto count time). There is no one "exposure time" that can be
   applied to all detectors.

   Additionally, when using multiple detectors as in ``count([det1, det2]))``,
   the user would need to provide a separate exposure time for each detector in
   the general case, which would grow wordy.

   One option is to set the time-related parameter(s) as a separate step.

   For interactive use:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Just an example. Your detector might have different names or numbers of
      # exposure-related parameters---which is the point.
      det.exposure_time.set(3)
      det.acquire_period.set(3.5)

   From a plan:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Just an example. Your detector might have different names or numbers of
      # exposure-related parameters---which is the point.
       yield from bluesky.plan_stubs.mv(
           det.exposure_time, 3,
           det.acquire_period, 3.5)

   Another is to write a custom plan that wraps :func:`count` and sets the
   exposure time. This plan can encode the details that bluesky in general
   can't know.

   .. code-block:: python

      def count_with_time(detectors, num, delay, exposure_time, *, md=None):
          # Assume all detectors have one exposure time component called
          # 'exposure_time' that fully specifies its exposure.
          for detector in detectors:
              yield from bluesky.plan_stubs.mv(detector.exposure_time, exposure_time)
          yield from bluesky.plans.count(detectors, num, delay, md=md)

.. autosummary::

   :nosignatures:

   count

Scans over one dimension
------------------------

The "dimension" might be a physical motor position, a temperature, or a
pseudo-axis. It's all the same to the plans. Examples:

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    from bluesky.plans import scan, rel_scan, list_scan

    # scan a motor from 1 to 5, taking 5 equally-spaced readings of 'det'
    RE(scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5))

    # scan a motor from 1 to 5 *relative to its current position*
    RE(rel_scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5))

    # scan a motor through a list of user-specified positions
    RE(list_scan([det], motor, [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]))

.. code-block:: python

    RE(scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5))

.. plot::

    from bluesky import RunEngine
    from bluesky.plans import scan
    from ophyd.sim import det, motor
    RE = RunEngine({})
    from bluesky.callbacks.best_effort import BestEffortCallback
    bec = BestEffortCallback()
    RE.subscribe(bec)
    RE(scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5))

.. note::

   Why don't scans have a ``delay`` parameter?

   You may have noticed that :func:`count` has a ``delay`` parameter but none
   of the scans do. This is intentional.

   The common reason for wanting a delay in a scan is to allow a motor to
   settle or a temperature controller to reach equilibrium. It is better to
   configure this on the respective devices, so that scans will always add the
   appropriate delay for the particular device being scanned.

   .. code-block:: python

      motor.settle_time = 1
      temperature_controller.settle_time = 10

   For many cases, this is more convenient and more robust than typing a delay
   parameter in every invocation of the scan. You only have to set it once, and
   it applies thereafter.

   This is why bluesky leaves ``delay`` out of the scans, to guide users toward
   an approach that will likely be a better fit than the one that might occur
   to them first. For situations where a ``delay`` parameter really is the
   right tool for the job, it is of course always possible to add a ``delay``
   parameter yourself by writing a custom plan. Here is one approach, using a
   :ref:`per_step hook <per_step_hook>`.

   .. code-block:: python

      import bluesky.plans
      import bluesky.plan_stubs

      def scan_with_delay(*args, delay=0, **kwargs):
          "Accepts all the normal 'scan' parameters, plus an optional delay."

          def one_nd_step_with_delay(detectors, step, pos_cache):
              "This is a copy of bluesky.plan_stubs.one_nd_step with a sleep added."
              motors = step.keys()
              yield from bluesky.plan_stubs.move_per_step(step, pos_cache)
              yield from bluesky.plan_stubs.sleep(delay)
              yield from bluesky.plan_stubs.trigger_and_read(list(detectors) + list(motors))

          kwargs.setdefault('per_step', one_nd_step_with_delay)
          yield from bluesky.plans.scan(*args, **kwargs)

.. _multi-dimensional_scans:

Multi-dimensional scans
-----------------------

See :ref:`tutorial_multiple_motors` in the tutorial for an introduction to the
common cases of moving multiple motors in coordination (i.e. moving X and Y
along a diagonal) or in a grid. The key examples are reproduced here. Again,
see the section linked for further explanation.

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det, motor1, motor2, motor3
    from bluesky.plans import scan, grid_scan, list_scan, list_grid_scan

    RE(scan(dets,
            motor1, -1.5, 1.5,  # scan motor1 from -1.5 to 1.5
            motor2, -0.1, 0.1,  # ...while scanning motor2 from -0.1 to 0.1
            11))  # ...both in 11 steps

    # Scan motor1 and motor2 jointly through a 5-point trajectory.
    RE(list_scan(dets, motor1, [1, 1, 3, 5, 8], motor2, [25, 16, 9, 4, 1]))

    # Scan a 3 x 5 x 2 grid.
    RE(grid_scan([det],
                 motor1, -1.5, 1.5, 3,  # no snake parameter for first motor
                 motor2, -0.1, 0.1, 5, False))
                 motor3, -200, 200, 5, False))

    # Scan a grid with abitrary spacings given as specific positions.
    RE(list_grid_scan([det],
                      motor1, [1, 1, 2, 3, 5],
                      motor2, [25, 16, 9]))

All of these plans are built on a more general-purpose plan,
:func:`~bluesky.plan.scan_nd`, which we can use for more specialized cases.

Some jargon: we speak of :func:`~bluesky.plans.scan`-like joint movement as an
"inner product" of trajectories and :func:`~bluesky.plans.grid_scan`-like
movement as an "outer product" of trajectories. The general case, moving some
motors together in an "inner product" against another motor (or motors) in an
"outer product," can be addressed using a ``cycler``.  Notice what happens when
we add or multiply ``cycler`` objects.

.. ipython:: python

    from cycler import cycler
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, motor3

    traj1 = cycler(motor1, [1, 2, 3])
    traj2 = cycler(motor2, [10, 20, 30])
    list(traj1)  # a trajectory for motor1
    list(traj1 + traj2)  # an "inner product" trajectory
    list(traj1 * traj2)  # an "outer product" trajectory

We have reproduced inner product and outer product. The real power comes in
when we combine them, like so. Here, motor1 and motor2 together in a mesh
against motor3.

.. ipython:: python

    traj3 = cycler(motor3, [100, 200, 300])
    list((traj1 + traj2) * traj3)

For more on cycler, we refer you to the
`cycler documentation <http://matplotlib.org/cycler/>`_. To build a plan
incorporating these trajectories, use our general N-dimensional scan plan,
:func:`scan_nd`.

Spiral trajectories
-------------------

We provide two-dimensional scans that trace out spiral trajectories.

A simple spiral:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    from bluesky.simulators import plot_raster_path
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, det
    from bluesky.plans import spiral

    plan = spiral([det], motor1, motor2, x_start=0.0, y_start=0.0, x_range=1.,
                  y_range=1.0, dr=0.1, nth=10)
    plot_raster_path(plan, 'motor1', 'motor2', probe_size=.01)


A fermat spiral:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    from bluesky.simulators import plot_raster_path
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, det
    from bluesky.plans import spiral_fermat

    plan = spiral_fermat([det], motor1, motor2, x_start=0.0, y_start=0.0,
                         x_range=2.0, y_range=2.0, dr=0.1, factor=2.0, tilt=0.0)
    plot_raster_path(plan, 'motor1', 'motor2', probe_size=.01, lw=0.1)


A square spiral:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    from bluesky.simulators import plot_raster_path
    from ophyd.sim import motor1, motor2, det
    from bluesky.plans import spiral_square

    plan = spiral_square([det], motor1, motor2, x_center=0.0, y_center=0.0,
                         x_range=1.0, y_range=1.0, x_num=11, y_num=11)

Adaptive scans
--------------

These are one-dimension scans with an adaptive step size tuned to move quickly
over flat regions can concentrate readings in areas of high variation by
computing the local slope aiming for a target delta y between consecutive
points.

This is a basic example of the power of adaptive plan logic.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import adaptive_scan
    from ophyd.sim import motor, det

    RE(adaptive_scan([det], 'det', motor,
                     start=-15,
                     stop=10,
                     min_step=0.01,
                     max_step=5,
                     target_delta=.05,
                     backstep=True))

.. plot::

    from bluesky import RunEngine
    from bluesky.plans import adaptive_scan
    from bluesky.callbacks.best_effort import BestEffortCallback
    bec = BestEffortCallback()
    from ophyd.sim import motor, det

    RE = RunEngine({})
    RE.subscribe(bec)

    RE(adaptive_scan([det], 'det', motor,
                     start=-15.5,
                     stop=10,
                     min_step=0.01,
                     max_step=5,
                     target_delta=.05,
                     backstep=True))

From left to right, the scan lengthens its stride through the flat region. At
first, it steps past the peak. The large jump causes it to double back and then
sample more densely through the peak. As the peak flattens, it lengthens its
stride again.

.. _preprocessors:

Plan Preprocessors
==================
.. currentmodule:: bluesky.preprocessors

.. _supplemental_data:

Supplemental Data
-----------------

Plan preprocessors modify a plans contents on the fly. One common use of a
preprocessor is to take "baseline" readings of a group of devices at the
beginning and end of each run. It is convenient to apply this to *all* plans
executed by a RunEngine using the :class:`SupplementalData`.

.. autoclass:: SupplementalData
    :members:

We have installed a "preprocessor" on the RunEngine. A preprocessor modifies
plans, supplementing or altering their instructions in some way. From now on,
every time we type ``RE(some_plan())``, the RunEngine will silently change
``some_plan()`` to ``sd(some_plan())``, where ``sd`` may insert some extra
instructions. Envision the instructions flow from ``some_plan`` to ``sd`` and
finally to ``RE``. The ``sd`` preprocessors has the opportunity to inspect
he
instructions as they go by and modify them as it sees fit before they get
processed by the RunEngine.

Preprocessor Wrappers and Decorators
------------------------------------

Preprocessors can make arbirary modifcations to a plan, and can get quite
devious. For example, the :func:`relative_set_wrapper` rewrites all positions
to be relative to the initial position.

.. code-block:: python

    def rel_scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num):
        absolute = scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num)
        relative = relative_set_wrapper(absolute, [motor])
        yield from relative

This is a subtle but remarkably powerful feature.

Wrappers like :func:`relative_set_wrapper` operate on a generator *instance*,
like ``scan(...)``. There are corresponding decorator functions like
``relative_set_decorator`` that operate on a generator
*function* itself, like :func:`scan`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Using a decorator to modify a generator function
    def rel_scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num):

        @relative_set_decorator([motor])  # unfamiliar syntax? -- see box below
        def inner_relative_scan():
            yield from scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num)

        yield from inner_relative_scan()

Incidentally, the name ``inner_relative_scan`` is just an internal variable,
so why did we choose such a verbose name? Why not just name it ``f``? That
would work, of course, but using a descriptive name can make debugging easier.
When navigating gnarly, deeply nested tracebacks, it helps if internal variables
have clear names.

.. note::

    The decorator syntax --- the ``@`` --- is a succinct way of passing a
    function to another function.

    This:

    .. code-block:: python

        @g
        def f(...):
            pass

        f(...)

    is equivalent to

    .. code-block:: python

        g(f)(...)

Built-in Preprocessors
----------------------
.. currentmodule:: bluesky.preprocessors

Each of the following functions named ``<something>_wrapper`` operates on
a generator instance. The corresponding functions named
``<something_decorator>`` operate on a generator function.

    suspend_wrapper

Custom Preprocessors
--------------------

The preprocessors are implemented using :func:`msg_mutator` (for altering
messages in place) and :func:`plan_mutator` (for inserting
messages into the plan or removing messages).

It's easiest to learn this by example, studying the implementations of the built-in
processors (catalogued above) in the
`the source of the plans module <https://github.com/NSLS-II/bluesky/blob/master/bluesky/plans.py>`_.

.. _per_step_hook:

Customize Step Scans with ``per_step``
======================================

The one-dimensional and multi-dimensional plans are composed (1) setup,
(2) a loop over a plan to perform at each position, (3) cleanup.

We provide a hook for customizing step (2). This enables you to write a
variation of an existing plan without starting from scratch.

For one-dimensional plans, the default inner loop is:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plan_stubs import checkpoint, abs_set, trigger_and_read

    def one_1d_step(detectors, motor, step):
        """
        Inner loop of a 1D step scan

        This is the default function for ``per_step`` param in 1D plans.
        """
        yield from checkpoint()
        yield from abs_set(motor, step, wait=True)
        return (yield from trigger_and_read(list(detectors) + [motor]))

Some user-defined function, ``custom_step``, with the same signature can be
used in its place:

.. code-block:: python

    scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 5, per_step=custom_step)

For convenience, this could be wrapped into the definition of a new plan:

.. code-block:: python

    def custom_scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, step, *, md=None):
        yield from scan([det], motor, start, stop, step, md=md
                        per_step=custom_step)

For multi-dimensional plans, the default inner loop is:

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.utils import short_uid
    from bluesky.plan_stubs import checkpoint, abs_set, wait, trigger_and_read

    def one_nd_step(detectors, step, pos_cache):
        """
        Inner loop of an N-dimensional step scan

        This is the default function for ``per_step`` param in ND plans.

        Parameters
        ----------
        detectors : iterable
            devices to read
        step : dict
            mapping motors to positions in this step
        pos_cache : dict
            mapping motors to their last-set positions
        """
        def move():
            yield from checkpoint()
            grp = short_uid('set')
            for motor, pos in step.items():
                if pos == pos_cache[motor]:
                    # This step does not move this motor.
                    continue
                yield from abs_set(motor, pos, group=grp)
                pos_cache[motor] = pos
            yield from wait(group=grp)

        motors = step.keys()
        yield from move()
        yield from trigger_and_read(list(detectors) + list(motors))

Likewise, a custom function with the same signature may be passed into the
``per_step`` argument of any of the multi-dimensional plans.
